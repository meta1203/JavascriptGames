Their are only as many Voronoi cells as there are points. So the last Voronoi cell
is at delaunay.points.length-1.

To keep the property that the cell contained by the position (x,y) is the point
of the nearest delaunay triangle we have to use the circumcenter.
This requires us to use Lloyd's Relaxation a few times to get a more bubble foam
look to the map. For each seed the amount of times we have to relax is unknown.
We will come up with a good number eventually.

In general the cell vertices will not be whole numbers.
